# Weather-Forecaster

## Description
This website was designed to connect to a dynamic Open Weather and Geocoder API to provide real-time as well as five-day forecasts for any city that is searched in the search input on the top-left corner of the page. Once a city has been searched, it will also be added to a list of 10 recent searches displayed along the left-hand side of the page 

## Usage
To use this page, you can simply type any city into the search bar, and then the current weather as well as the five-day forecast for that specifc city will appear.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to limitations with the OpenWeather API, you must incluce the City, State, and Country to appropriately fetch data from the API. This is because, without proper specification, the API will not know which specifc city to call. However, for cities wihtin the US, you should be able to only include the city and state name to receive the weather data.
